title: "Computing colored Khovanov homology"
collection: publications
category: preprint
excerpt: 'We compare eight versions of finite-dimensional categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial and show that they yield isomorphic results over a field of characteristic zero. As an application, we verify a physics-motivated conjectural formula for colored superpolynomials based on Poincaré polynomials of the Khovanov homology of cables. We also obtain a conjectural closed formula for the Poincaré series of the skein lasagna module of $$\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$$. Accompanying this note is an online database of colored superpolynomials. '
